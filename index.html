                <h3>Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda</h3>
                <p> Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, was born in 1861 in Calamba, Laguna, to an educated and affluent family. His early education, guided by his mother, instilled in him strong moral values. Despite facing discrimination, he excelled academically and later 
                    studied at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and the University of Santo Tomas. Rizal's 
                     involvement in various fields such as poetry, drama, and athletics showcased his diverse talents and interests.
                      His experiences of injustice fueled his desire for social reform, leading him to pursue further studies in Europe. 
                      In Madrid and Paris, he became involved in nationalist movements and wrote influential novels exposing Spanish colonial injustices. Through his writings, particularly "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo,"
                      he advocated for reforms and called for an end to oppressive practices.</p>
                <p>Despite facing threats and persecution from the Spanish authorities, Rizal remained steadfast in 
                    his commitment to the Filipino people and their aspirations for freedom. His martyrdom at the hands
                     of the colonial regime further fueled the flames of
                     resistance and inspired generations of Filipinos to continue the struggle for independence.
                    Rizal's legacy extends beyond his role as a nationalist hero; he is also remembered for
                     his contributions to education, healthcare, and social welfare in the Philippines. 
                     His life and teachings continue to inspire Filipinos to uphold the values of integrity,
                      patriotism, and solidarity in the pursuit of a just and prosperous society. </p>

            <h3>Noli Me Tangere & El Filibusterismo</h3>
            <p>"Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo" are important because they awakened nationalist sentiments, 
                exposed colonial oppression, advocated for reform, inspired revolution, and stand as literary masterpieces in Philippine literature.</p>

        <div class="box-container">

            <div class="box">
                <p>"Noli Me Tangere," published in 1887, stands as a cornerstone of Philippine literature and history. 
                    With its title translating to "Touch Me Not" in Latin, the novel serves as a powerful 
                    social commentary on the injustices inflicted by Spanish colonial authorities and the clergy upon the Filipino people during the late 19th century. Through vivid characters and compelling storytelling, Rizal skillfully depicts the harsh realities of colonial rule, showcasing the pervasive corruption, oppression, and hypocrisy prevalent in Philippine society. The protagonist, Crisostomo Ibarra, returns to the Philippines from Europe only to confront the systemic injustices and abuses perpetrated by the ruling class. Rizal's primary objective with "Noli Me Tangere" was to shed light on these 
                    injustices, galvanizing Filipinos to seek reform and fight for their rights. Today,
                     the novel remains an essential component of Filipino education, revered as one of 
                     the most significant literary works in Philippine history, inspiring generations to stand against oppression and strive for justice and equality.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>"El Filibusterismo," published in 1891 as the sequel to "Noli Me Tangere," continues José Rizal's exploration of t
                    he Philippine society under Spanish colonial rule. Its title, translating to "The Reign of Greed" or "The Filibuster," 
                    reflects the novel's themes of corruption and oppression. Building upon its predecessor's foundation, "El Filibusterismo" 
                    delves deeper into the injustices faced by the Filipino people and the simmering discontent that leads to rebellion. 
                    The protagonist, Simoun, emerges as a new identity for Crisostomo Ibarra from "Noli Me Tangere," with a 
                    calculated plan to incite revolution against the Spanish authorities. Through Simoun's character, Rizal
                     intricately examines the complexities of resistance and revolution, highlighting the moral dilemmas and 
                     consequences associated with pursuing change through violent means. "El Filibusterismo" not only solidifies Rizal's 
                     reputation as a nationalist writer and thinker but also serves as a critical reflection on the shortcomings of the
                      Philippine Revolution. Like its predecessor, this novel is celebrated as a 
                    classic of Philippine literature, studied extensively in educational institutions 
                    for its profound insights into colonial oppression and the quest for liberation.</p>
